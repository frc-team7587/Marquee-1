# Run Marquee Commands In a Loop

The `Robot` class in this package runs a variety of Marquee
commands in a loop. Please see the
[`Robot`](Robot.java)class for details.

To test the display:

1. Connect the Marquee to the ESP32 and the ESP32 to the
   RoboRio
2. Connect power to the display, the ESP32, and the RoboRio.
3. Compile and upload the Marquee code to the ESP32
4. Build this code together with the Marquee library (which
   resides in this project).
5. Deploy the results of the previous steps to the RoboRio
6. Watch it go

The ESP32 code and Marquee library are (or should be, at least)
well documented. Please read their documentation before you
run this example.
